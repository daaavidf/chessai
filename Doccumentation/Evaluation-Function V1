I'll add a proper evaluation function that makes the AI pick the best move instead of random ones!Chess Game with Random AIInteractive artifact ∙ Version 2 Perfect! I've upgraded your chess AI to use a proper evaluation function. Here's what I added:
Key Improvements:
1. Evaluation Function
The AI now evaluates positions based on:

Material value: Pawns=100, Knights=320, Bishops=330, Rooks=500, Queens=900, Kings=20000
Piece positioning: Using piece-square tables that reward good piece placement (e.g., knights in the center, pawns advancing)

2. Minimax Algorithm
The AI now looks 3 moves ahead and uses the minimax algorithm to:

Maximize its own position
Minimize your position
Consider all possible move sequences

3. Alpha-Beta Pruning
This optimization makes the AI search much faster by eliminating branches that won't affect the final decision.
How It Works:

Material counting: The AI knows a queen is worth more than a pawn
Positional awareness: Knights are better in the center, pawns should advance, etc.
Strategic thinking: It looks 3 moves ahead to find the best sequence
Tactical awareness: It can spot opportunities to capture pieces or create threats

Performance:
The AI now plays at a beginner-to-intermediate level and will:

✅ Capture undefended pieces
✅ Develop pieces properly
✅ Avoid blunders (mostly)
✅ Create basic tactical threats

The depth is set to 3 (looks 3 moves ahead). You can increase it for stronger play, but it will think longer. Try playing against it now - it should be much more challenging!

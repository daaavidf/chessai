Perfect! I've created a comprehensive chess AI testing interface for you. Here's what it includes:
🎯 Key Features:
Test Configuration:

Choose opponent strength: Random moves, Material-only AI (~600 ELO), or Basic AI (~800 ELO)
Select your AI's color: White, Black, or Both (alternating each game)
Set number of games: Test from 1 to 100 games automatically

Real-time Statistics:

✅ Wins, Losses, Draws tracking
📊 Win rate percentage
📈 Progress bar showing completion
📝 Detailed game log with results

Controls:

▶️ Start: Begin automated testing
⏸️ Pause/Resume: Pause testing at any time
⏹️ Stop: End testing early
🔄 Reset Stats: Clear all statistics
⚡ Speed slider: Adjust how fast games play (50ms - 2000ms per move)

Export Options:

📊 Export to CSV: Get spreadsheet-ready data with all game details
♟️ Export to PGN: Download all games in standard chess notation for analysis in other tools

🔬 How to Use for ELO Estimation:

Baseline Test: Run 20 games vs Random Moves

Your AI should win 95%+ (confirms it's working)


Material Test: Run 50 games vs Material-only AI

Win rate 70%+ means your AI is significantly stronger


Advanced Test: Run 50 games vs Basic AI

This is testing against a similar-strength opponent
~50% win rate means they're equally matched (~800-1000 ELO)
70%+ means your AI is stronger
<30% means you need improvements



📊 Interpreting Results:

90%+ wins vs Random: ✅ AI is functional
70%+ wins vs Material-only: Your AI ≈ 900-1100 ELO
50-70% vs Material-only: Your AI ≈ 700-900 ELO
50% vs Basic AI: Your AI ≈ 800-1000 ELO
70%+ vs Basic AI: Your AI ≈ 1100-1300 ELO

Perfect! I've created a complete chess game for you. Here's how to set it up in your Visual Studio project:
How to Use This:

In Visual Studio:

Create a new file called index.html in your GitHub project folder
Copy the code from the artifact above into this file
Save it


To run it:

Right-click on index.html in Visual Studio
Select "Open in Browser" or just double-click the file in your file explorer
The game will open in your web browser!



How It Works:
Chess.js handles all the game logic:

Tracks legal moves
Checks for checkmate, stalemate, etc.
Validates moves

Chessboard.js handles the visualization:

Shows the chess pieces
Allows drag-and-drop
Updates the board display

The AI (in the makeRandomMove function):

Gets all legal moves with game.moves()
Picks one randomly
Makes that move

Features included:

✅ Play as White against a random AI (Black)
✅ Drag and drop pieces
✅ Shows game status (check, checkmate, etc.)
✅ Move history display
✅ New Game button
✅ Undo button (takes back both your move and AI's move)

Try it out! You'll see the AI isn't very smart (it just picks random moves), but it's a great starting point. Later, you could improve it by adding move evaluation to make it play better.
